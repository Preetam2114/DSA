## Analysis of Algorithms (Asymptotic Notations): 

The main idea of asymptotic analysis is to have a measure of efficiency of algorithms that doesn’t depend on machine specific constants, and doesn’t require algorithms to be implemented and time taken by programs to be compared.

Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools to represent time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis. The following 3 asymptotic notations are mostly used to represent time complexity of algorithms.

#### **1) Θ Notation:** 
The theta notation bounds a functions from above and below, so it defines exact asymptotic behavior.
A simple way to get Theta notation of an expression is to drop low order terms and ignore leading constants. For example, consider the following expression.

$$3n^{3}+6n^{2}+6000=\theta(n^{3})$$

Dropping lower order terms is always fine because there will always be a n0 after which $\theta(n^{3})$ has higher values than $\theta(n^{2})$ irrespective of the constants involved. For a given function g(n), we denote Θ(g(n)) is following set of functions.

    Θ(g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0 such 
                 that 0 <= c1*g(n) <= f(n) <= c2*g(n) for all n >= n0}

The above definition means, if f(n) is theta of g(n), then the value f(n) is always between c1 * g(n) and c2 * g(n) for large values of n (n >= n0). The definition of theta also requires that f(n) must be non-negative for values of n greater than n0.
