### **Analysis of Algorithms (Analysis of Loops):**

#### **Lets analyse iterative programs with simple examples is discussed.**

**1) O(1):**

Time complexity of a function (or set of statements) is considered as O(1) if it doesn’t contain loop, recursion and call to any other non-constant time function.

    // set of non-recursive and non-loop statements

    For example swap() function has O(1) time complexity.

**2) O(n):**

Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(n) if the loop variables is incremented / decremented by a constant amount. For example following functions have O(n) time complexity.

    // Here c is a positive integer constant   
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += c) {  
            // some O(1) expressions
    }

    for (int i = n; i > 0; i -= c) {
            // some O(1) expressions
    }

**3) O(n$^{c}$):**
   
Time complexity of nested loops is equal to the number of times the innermost statement is executed. For example the following sample loops have O(n$^2$) time complexity

    for (int i = 1; i <=n; i += c) {
        for (int j = 1; j <=n; j += c) {
            // some O(1) expressions
        }
    }

    for (int i = n; i > 0; i -= c) {
        for (int j = i+1; j <=n; j += c) {
            // some O(1) expressions
    }

For example Selection sort and Insertion Sort have O(n2) time complexity.

**4) O(Logn):**

Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(Logn) if the loop variables is divided / multiplied by a constant amount.

    for (int i = 1; i <=n; i *= c) {
        // some O(1) expressions
    }
    for (int i = n; i > 0; i /= c) {
        // some O(1) expressions
    }

For example Binary Search(refer iterative implementation) has O(Logn) time complexity. Let us see mathematically how it is O(Log n). The series that we get in first loop is 1, c, c$^{2}$, c$^{3}$, … c$^{k}$. If we put k equals to $log_{c}n$, we get c$^{log_{c}n}$ which is n.

**5) O(LogLogn):**

Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(LogLogn) if the loop variables is reduced / increased exponentially by a constant amount.

    // Here c is a constant greater than 1   
    for (int i = 2; i <=n; i = pow(i, c)) { 
        // some O(1) expressions
    }
    //Here fun is sqrt or cuberoot or any other constant root
    for (int i = n; i > 1; i = fun(i)) { 
        // some O(1) expressions
    }
