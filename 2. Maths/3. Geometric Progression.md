### Problem statement: 
- Find nth term of a Geometric Progression.

### Algorithm:

- The nth term of a GP series is T$_n$ = ar$^{n-1}$, where a = first term and r = common ratio = T$_n$/T$_{n-1}$) .


### Code:

``` cpp

    int nthTermGp(int n,int a,int r){
        return a*pow(r,n-1);
    }

```

### Problem statement: 
- Find sum of first n terms of Geometric Progression.

### Algorithm:

- The formula applied to calculate sum of first n terms of a Geometric Progression is S$_n$ = $\frac{a(r^{n}-1)}{r-1}$


### Code:

``` cpp

    int sumofnterms(int n,int a,int r){
        return a*(pow(r,n)-1)/(r-1);
    }

```
