### Problem statement: 

- Find n$^{th}$ term of an Arithmatic progression.

### Algorithm:

- N$^{th}$ term of an AP is equal to a + (n-1)d where a is first term of the AP.


### Code:

``` cpp

    // Nth term of an AP
    int nthTerm(int n, int a, int d){
        return a+((n-1)*d);
    }

```

### Problem statement: 

- Find sum of two numbers equidistant from beginning and end.

### Algorithm:

- The sum of any two numbers equidistant from the beginning and the end is equal to the sum of the first and last terms.

### Code:

``` cpp

    // Sum of any two numbers equidistant from the beginning and the end
    int nthTerm(int n, int a, int d){
        return (2*a)+((n-1)*d);
    }

```
