### Problem statement: 

- Find n$^{th}$ term of an Arithmatic progression.

### Algorithm:

- N$^{th}$ term of an AP is equal to a + (n-1)d where a is first term of the AP.


### Code:

``` cpp

    // Nth term of an AP
    int nthTerm(int n, int a, int d){
        return a+((n-1)*d);
    }

```

### Problem statement: 

- Find sum of two numbers equidistant from beginning and end.

### Algorithm:

- The sum of any two numbers equidistant from the beginning and the end is equal to the sum of the first and last terms.

### Code:

``` cpp

    // Sum of any two numbers equidistant from the beginning and the end
    int nthTerm(int n, int a, int d){
        return (2*a)+((n-1)*d);
    }

```

### Problem statement: 
- Find sum of first n terms in Arithmatic progression.

### Algorithm:
- The sum of arithmatic progression is equal to $\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)$

### Code:

``` cpp

    // Sum of first n terms in Arithmatic progression
    int sumofAp(int n, int a, int d){
        return (n/2)+((2*n)+(n-1)*d);
    }

```

### Problem statement: 
- Find number of terms in an Arithmatic progression.

### Algorithm:
- The the number of terms is an Arithmatic progression can be found using $\frac{(l-a)}{d}$ + 1

### Code:

``` cpp

    // Number of terms in an Arithmatic progression
    int numberofterms(int n, int a, int d){
        return (((a+(n-1)d)-a)/d)+1;
    }

```

### Problem statement: 
- Find sum of squares of first n natural numbers.

### Algorithm:
- The sum of squares of first n natural number can be found using the given formula $\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$

### Code:

``` cpp

    // Sum of squares of first n natural numbers
    int sumofsquares(int n){
        return (n*(n+1)*(2*n+1))/6;
    }

```
